Network Optimization
====================

Various algorithms for solving Max-Bandwidth-Path problem and detailed performance report.

1. Dijkstra
2. Dijkstra with Heap
3. Kruskal

In process also creating various other useful data structures to be used for the algorithm implementation:
1. Queue
2. Linked List
3. Set (Union, Find, Make)
4. Heaps (Min/Max)
5. Heap for Graph Edge structure
6. Random Vertex(Random Vertex Generator from a list)
