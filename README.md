Network Optimization
====================

Various algorithms for solving Max-Bandwidth-Path problem and detailed performance report.

1. Dijkstra
2. Dijkstra with Heap
3. Kruskal

In process also creating various other useful data structures to be used for the algorithm implementation:
1. Queue
2. Linked List
3. Set (Union, Find, Make)
4. Heaps (Min/Max)
5. Heap for Graph Edge structure
6. Random Vertex(Random Vertex Generator from a list)

How to check performance?
To check the peformance of various algorithms 2 types of graphs are considerd.
1. Graph with 5000 vertices and 6 degree of edges
2. Graph with 5000 vertices and 1000 degree of edges

We can tune the graphs accordingly by going changing the properties in the Network_Properties.h file.

The performance is calculated by running the file Network_Optimzation.c.
Once, the program is done, the results are generated in file results.txt.

Note: One must check the results.txt, results are quite interesting.
